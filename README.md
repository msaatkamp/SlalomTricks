# SlalomTricks
Slalom Tricks is a simple website made with .Net / C# tecnologies
In the future I may continue to develop it into a application so athletes can record the tricks they already know,
see videos about other tricks and share some content in this page.

There's currently two functions, one is to read the recorded tricks in the DB, and the other is to add more tricks.
This is currently how it looks like:
